I discovered a handy command-line tool for checking the weather report while watching [Mischa's video](https://youtu.be/bzkrmkGDQJA).

To check the weather, you should have [curl](https://curl.se/download.html) installed and then run the following in your command-line

```shell
 curl wttr.in
```

By default, this will show a weather report based on your location. You can also view other locations using:

```shell
 curl wttr.in/Nairobi
```
