Developers typically focus on the coding and development aspects of a project. Clarity in roles is essential, with designers handling tasks from theme selection to UI design, passing the completed work to developers for implementation.

While this workflow has its advantages, it's crucial for developers to grasp basic design principles. Personally, I've experienced both approaches but lean towards involvement in both design and programming phases.

Here, I'll share resources to help developers grasp fundamental design principles, enhancing their ability to create significantly better products. I've curated beginner-friendly documentation covering areas such as color theory, typography, iconography, layout design, and general-purpose guides.

Think of these resources as references; there's no need to absorb everything at once. Instead, choose what's relevant to your current needs and revisit for additional guidance later on.
